# DOORS Access Framework Contribution Guide

To contribute, please create a new branch, apply your changes and push it to this repository. Then, create a merge request. If the code passes the review, it will be merged into master.

This project uses the netbeans default Java formatting. Please open any source file you edited in NetBeans with a clean formatting config, and click the menu item Source -> Format to achieve a correct code layout. We have looked into providing a .editorconfig file, but so far the work required has outweighed the benefits. If you feel like writing one, go ahead!
